## Setup

- Run with Python 3.11. 
- Create a virtual environment with packages from `requirements.txt` using PyCharm's GUI or the command line. 
- Create a file called `.env` with the necessary environment variables set.

## Running

Activate the virtual environment if it isn't already, then use `flask run` to start the dev server.

To reset the database, run the `init-db.py` script or delete the `/instance/project.db` file.
